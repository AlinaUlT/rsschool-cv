## Code example:
Consider an array/list of sheep where some sheep may be missing from their place. We need a function that counts the number of sheep present in the array (true means present).
```
function countSheeps(arrayOfSheep) {
 let result = 0;
 for (let i = 0; i < arrayOfSheep.length; i++){
   let sheepNumberI = arrayOfSheep[i];
   if (sheepNumberI === true) {
      result++;
    }
 } 
  return result;
} 
```
